RoadCash aims to mitigate the problem of distracted driving, especially phone usage. Over 6% of car accidents and nearly 12% of fatal collisions can be attributed to phone use (National Safety Council). 
To put this into scale, there are 2.6 million accidents worldwide annually due to phone usage, according to NSC. However, this number is estimated to be much higher, due to the lack of witnesses and also drivers often not admitting to phone usage. 
By eliminating distracted phone use on the road, we can successfully prevent countless tragedies and make our roads safer for everyone. 

RoadCash encourages drivers to put their phones aside, and rewards undistracted driving with points that can be redeemed for various rewards, including gift cards.
